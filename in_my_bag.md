This is what's taking up space in my bag, a [Tamrac Anvil 17 backpack](http://www.tamrac.com/collections/backpacks/products/anvil-17). 

Pretty happy with this set up. All lenses have their own strengths, so there's no piece of equipment that just sits in the bag and collects dust. What's missing is really the ability to get further reach when taking photos of birds and other wildlife, as well as getting really close to for example insects and flowers.
