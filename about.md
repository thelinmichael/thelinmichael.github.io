Hey! I'm Michael Thelin. 

Some quick work facts - I've been at Spotify since early 2013, currently as an Engineering Team Lead but have contributed as a Test Automation Developer and Web Developer as well. Regardless of role, my mission since I started at Spotify has been to enable companies and other third-party developers to build great product integrations using our [Developer platform](https://developer.spotify.com). An example of a larger integrations is [the Spotify app on Playstation](http://www.theverge.com/2015/3/30/8303279/spotify-sony-ps4-ps3-launch). My open sourced code is on [Github](https://github.com/thelinmichael), and my career profile can be found on [LinkedIn](https://se.linkedin.com/in/michaelthelin).

I'm a photography hobbyist, and most of the stuff that I find worth sharing I post on [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/96687157@N03/). Some of the photos are available for sale at [Shutterstock](https://www.shutterstock.com/g/michaelthelin). (I've made a total of $2.7 so far, so I'm not ready to give up my day job yet.)

My digital footprint as an amateur runner is on [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/9436776).

The contents of this site is a mix of work, photography, and running, and is mainly written for my own amusement.
