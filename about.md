Hey! I'm Michael Thelin.

I'm working at Spotify's office in Stockholm since early 2013, currently as an Engineering Team Lead and previously as a Web Developer and Test Automation Developer. Regardless of role my focus has always been to enable companies and other third-party developers to build great products using Spotify. Examples of such are [Sony Playstation](http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/mar/30/sony-spotify-playstation-music-streaming) and [Shazam](http://www.engadget.com/2015/08/06/shazam-add-songs-spotify-rdio-playlists/).

You can find more information about me on [Github](https://github.com/thelinmichael) or [LinkedIn](https://se.linkedin.com/in/michaelthelin). You can also tweet at [@michaelthelin](https://twitter.com/michaelthelin) or email thelinmichael@gmail.com.
