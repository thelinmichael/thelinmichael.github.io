<p>Hey, I'm Michael. Since March 2013, I work at Spotify's Stockholm office as a Software Developer.</p>
<p>Before I joined Spotify, I spent a year and a half working as a Developer at <a title="WDS" href="http://www.wds.co" target="_blank">WDS</a> in <a title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poole" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poole" target="_blank">Poole</a>, a town in southern England. I arrived in England after having lived in smoggy but always exciting Shanghai for a year, where I was working as an Intern Developer at Ebay and studying as an exchange student at <a title="http://www.tongji.edu.cn/english/" href="http://www.tongji.edu.cn/english/" target="_blank">Tongji University</a>. The exchange was made possible through <a title="UU" href="http://www.uu.se" target="_blank">Uppsal</a><a title="UU" href="http://www.uu.se" target="_blank">a University</a>, where I studied Computer Science. If you've got the opportunity to move abroad for a while, just do it, it's given me so many valuable experiences.</p>
<p>I hope to use this space to write about my thoughts on things related to software and the tech-side of the on-demand music-streaming industry. I like open source and I try to be active through <a title="http://www.github.com/thelinmichael" href="http://www.github.com/thelinmichael" target="_blank">Github</a>. If you want to contact me, please leave a comment or throw me an email at <em>thelinmichael</em> at <em>Google's mail service</em>.</p>
