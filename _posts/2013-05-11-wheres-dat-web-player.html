<p>I've been using <a title="Web Player" href="http://play.spotify.com" target="_blank">Spotify's Web Player</a> instead of the regular desktop client so that I'll get more exposure to it. I tend to not want to use it over the desktop client because it has less features (no social flow for example).</p>
<p>After using it for a few days, I started to think that it was a bit painful to switch to the tab holding the Web Player to add a currently playing track to a playlist and then get back to the tab I was working in. Well, not painful, but.. Just not as quick as I'd like it.</p>
<p>So I created a simple Chrome extension that switches tab to the Web Player when clicking its icon in the Chrome bar (or using a keyboard short-cut), and switches back when clicking it again. If you also want to save a good five seconds per tab switch, you can get itÂ <a title="Spotify Web Player Toggler" href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/spotify-web-player-toggle/mmoigdfhopbgbbpdojiljechdnlbnani?hl=sv" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
