<p>Want to mention this even though it is 5 weeks after it actually happened. <a title="http://barcampbournemouth.org/" href="http://barcampbournemouth.org/">Bournemouth Barcamp</a> was absolutely worth the time, in case anyone googles for opinions on it when next years event is approaching. It is free, friendly, and had some interesting talks! Definitely enjoyed the <a href="http://barcampbournemouth.org/play-with-the-gamepad-api-and-more-at-the-mozilla-hackspace/">presentation on Firefox's Gamepad API</a> (<a href="http://vimeo.com/33668443">video </a><a href="http://vimeo.com/33668443">demo here</a>) from Mozilla Tech Evangelist <a href="http://rawkes.com">Rob Hawkes</a><em>. </em></p>
<p><em></em>Feels like about time browsers can be controlled by joysticks. And hopefully, we'll see a lot of  in-browser games (and other stuff) with gamepad support games this year. Not only in Firefox though, Chrome developers seem to have come a long way as well.</p>
