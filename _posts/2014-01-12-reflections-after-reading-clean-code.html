<p>I've just finished reading <a title="http://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882" href="http://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882" target="_blank">Clean Code by Robert C. Martin</a>, and it has left me with a lot of things to think about regarding the way I write my code. A good thing!</p>
<p>The book covers a broad range of topics, including what to think about when naming, how and when to write comments, refactoring tactics, and smells from unclean code.  A chapter called Smells and Heuristics especially caught my nose, as it categorises bad practices and discusses about how to avoid them. Not causing <a title="http://sourcemaking.com/refactoring/feature-envy" href="http://sourcemaking.com/refactoring/feature-envy" target="_blank">Feature Envy</a> and avoid breaking the <a title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_Demeter" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_Demeter" target="_blank">Law of Demeter</a> (or Principle of Least Knowledge) is something that I need to think about in order to not cause tight coupling.</p>
<p>I really enjoyed this book! Give it a go.</p>
