<p>Magic numbers can mean several things, but the one I'm going to address is the sort of number which doesn't give the reader any idea of why it has a certain value.</p>
<p>This piece of Java code gives an example of a magic numbers:</p>
<pre class="java" name="code">
World world = new World();
world.addCountry(46);
</pre>
<p>Without looking further into the code, it would be very difficult to tell why the parameter sent into the addCountry-method is 46.</p>
<pre class="java" name="code">
final int COUNTRYCODE_SWEDEN = 46;
World world = new World();
world.addCountry(COUNTRYCODE_SWEDEN);
</pre>
<p>The code takes up more lines, but becomes both easier to read and more flexible. Sweden's country code might be needed again, and by making it a variable it only needs changing at a single place.</p>
