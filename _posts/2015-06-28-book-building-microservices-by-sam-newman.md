Just finished reading [Building Microservices](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920033158.do) by Sam Newman. In really simple words it explains what's great about microservices architectures, and what to think about when designing, developing, deploying, and monitoring them.

A lot of it will seem very fundamental and basic to seasoned backend developers - the microservice trend has been ongoing for some time now. But although I've been building services for a while now, I still found a lot useful things in the book that I'll take with me. I didn't for example know about [Conway's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_law), which basically says that the software built by a company will reflect the company's organisational structure.

I really recommend this book for developers who are either new to building backend services or is working with a monolithic architecture and is trying to work out how to make the switch to a microservice architecture but wondering how to go about doing so.
