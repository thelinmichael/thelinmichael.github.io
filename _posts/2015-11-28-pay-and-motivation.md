When does pay become a demotivator, and when does it become a motivator? Studies presented by Daniel Pink in his book [Drive](http://www.amazon.com/Drive-Surprising-Truth-About-Motivates/dp/1594484805) shows that pay works as a motivator   if the tasks are monotonous and mechanical. More advanced tasks are on the other hand performed worse if given a larger monetary reward. For these jobs salaries should be high enough to not be an issue.

This is all well and good, but I've seen pay cause people to become demotivated because they perceive that they're being compensated badly in comparison to others. What Pink is arguing simply doesn't apply.

Even if you're feeling that you're working on something with a worthwhile and purposeful goal, having time to innovate, and learn continuously, pay is still a potentially demotivating factor. (I'd love to add inclusion to these motivators as [Meri Williams](http://blog.meriwilliams.com/) argues.)

Knowing that what you believe are less "productive" employees make significantly more than you and that the company is in its power to correct this (by increasing your salary and not decreasing theirs), I find it likely that you'll feel that the company doesn't value you as much as other employees.

Of course, there are more reasons to why you'd believe that you are compensated unfairly - it could be that management simply doesn't perceive you the same way you do. If you believe that this is because your manager simply doesn't have insight into what you're doing, then the feedback cycle needs to be fixed.

Another reason is that you entered the company on a relatively low pay level. Some companise try to have higher relative increases for these employees to help them catch up eventually. This can however take many years. There might be company policies causing the employee to become "salary blocked" since the employee can't catch up fast enough without quitting and rejoining the company.

I haven't read Drive and I'm planning to do so. I'm also looking for papers that show how pay gaps can work as a strong demotivator, as well as the outcomes in situations where companies have decided to reveal individual pay, or at least median pay grades for different roles.
