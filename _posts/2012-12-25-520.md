Celebrating the Christmas holiday in exile isn't great fun, but at least it's a few days off to relax and do whatever comes to mind. For some time now, I've wondered extensions for Chrome work and what they're capable of, so I decided to write something simple.

I figured that there must be some places on the Interwebs that would serve up weather related data for free, and after some Googling I found the [Wunderground API](http://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/ "http://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/"). It's free to use for a limited amount of hits per day, and they've got end points for all kinds of stuff. Their [astronomy end point](http://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/d/docs?d=data/astronomy "http://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/d/docs?d=data/astronomy")  returns information on time for sunset and sunrise as well as the number of days since new moon. I created an extension called [Lunar Phases](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lunar-phases/gonoapcaanboccgahfbaegafbckgmceh "https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lunar-phases/gonoapcaanboccgahfbaegafbckgmceh") and published it through [Google's Webstore](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/ "https://chrome.google.com/webstore/"). Everything took a few hours to do, and it was much easier than I anticipated. Follow [Google's own tutorials and samples](http://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted.html "http://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted.html") to get up to speed.

I put the code on [GitHub](https://github.com/thelinmichael/lunar-phases "https://github.com/thelinmichael/lunar-phases"), but there's also a huge amount of [samples available](http://developer.chrome.com/extensions/samples.html "http://developer.chrome.com/extensions/samples.html") from Google.

Merry Christmas!
