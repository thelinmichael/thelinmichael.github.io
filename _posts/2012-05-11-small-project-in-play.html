<p>This is a screendump of a small project I did at work to get more comfortable with both <a title="http://www.playframework.org" href="http://www.playframework.org" target="_blank">Play! Framework</a>  and our own products. One of our products is an email lookup, and this project is simply a front-end for it built in Play.</p>
<p>To use the product, the user simply uses the query parameter "emailAddress" to specify which email address to look up. For example, <em>http://www.some-domain.com/emailAddress=michael@yahoo.co.uk. </em>Using the form just hits the site again, and adds the form value to the query parameter on the end.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://54.247.113.130/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Screenshot-at-2012-05-09-13_37_41.png"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-274" title="Screenshot at 2012-05-09 13_37_41" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Screenshot-at-2012-05-09-13_37_41.png" alt="" width="680" height="384" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Result page for <em>/emailAddress=michael@yahoo.co.uk. </em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I did not take the screen dump at that time on purpose.. I really enjoy working in Play. It gives you a clear definition of your models, views and controllers, and is very easy to get up and running. It also comes with a great test functionality, and lots more. The Play website's tutorial is great if you want to take it for a spin.</p>
