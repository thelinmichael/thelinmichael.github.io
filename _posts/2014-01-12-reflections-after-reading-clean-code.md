I've just finished reading [Clean Code by Robert C. Martin](http://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882 "http://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882"), and it has left me with a lot of things to think about regarding the way I write my code. A good thing!

The book covers a broad range of topics, including what to think about when naming, how and when to write comments, refactoring tactics, and smells from unclean code.  A chapter called Smells and Heuristics especially caught my nose, as it categorises bad practices and discusses about how to avoid them. Not causing [Feature Envy](http://sourcemaking.com/refactoring/feature-envy "http://sourcemaking.com/refactoring/feature-envy") and avoid breaking the [Law of Demeter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_Demeter "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_Demeter") (or Principle of Least Knowledge) is something that I need to think about in order to not cause tight coupling.

I really enjoyed this book! Give it a go.
