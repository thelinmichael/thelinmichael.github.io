<p>Celebrating the Christmas holiday in exile isn't great fun, but at least it's a few days off to relax and do whatever comes to mind. For some time now, I've wondered extensions for Chrome work and what they're capable of, so I decided to write something simple.</p>
<p>I figured that there must be some places on the Interwebs that would serve up weather related data for free, and after some Googling I found the <a title="http://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/" href="http://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/" target="_blank">Wunderground API</a>. It's free to use for a limited amount of hits per day, and they've got end points for all kinds of stuff. Their <a title="http://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/d/docs?d=data/astronomy" href="http://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/d/docs?d=data/astronomy" target="_blank">astronomy end point</a>  returns information on time for sunset and sunrise as well as the number of days since new moon. I created an extension called <a title="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lunar-phases/gonoapcaanboccgahfbaegafbckgmceh" href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lunar-phases/gonoapcaanboccgahfbaegafbckgmceh" target="_blank">Lunar Phases</a> and published it through <a title="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/" href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/" target="_blank">Google's Webstore</a>. Everything took a few hours to do, and it was much easier than I anticipated. Follow <a title="http://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted.html" href="http://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted.html" target="_blank">Google's own tutorials and samples</a> to get up to speed.</p>
<p>I put the code on <a title="https://github.com/thelinmichael/lunar-phases" href="https://github.com/thelinmichael/lunar-phases">GitHub</a>, but there's also a huge amount of <a title="http://developer.chrome.com/extensions/samples.html" href="http://developer.chrome.com/extensions/samples.html" target="_blank">samples available</a> from Google.</p>

<p>Merry Christmas!</p>
