<p>My last post was written on February 14th and a lot of stuff has happened in the last three months. I've moved from England to Sweden, changed employer from WDS to Spotify, and switched my formal job description from Developer to Test Automation Developer. And some other stuff, like gaining five kilos due to the treacherously good quality of the Swedish pizzas.</p>
