<p>The most obvious benefit of knowing your tools is that you save time. It also makes it easier to keep a good work flow, especially if you're working as a pair. It is understandable that the pair navigator has a harder time to focus on the task at hand if the driver is clicking around in menus instead of using key short-cuts.</p>
<p>So here are a few things that I find very helpful, both when working alone or when acting as a navigator in a pair programming session.</p>
<p><strong>General environment short-cuts</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ctrl + ← and Ctrl + →    </strong>Making the cursor jump between words works in most environments I know of, and is applicable everywhere. After starting to use this, I tend to use the mouse much less. Ctrl + Delete and Ctrl + Backspace are useful as well.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>IDE short-cuts</strong></p>
<p>A lot of the functionality below can be reached via right-clicking on the code editing window. Still, using the short-cuts is something everyone should move towards..</p>
<p>Short-cut values are Eclipse IDE defaults.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Remove line</strong>. Ctrl + D. Probably the short-cut I use the most.</li>
<li><strong>Create and jump to the next line</strong>. Shift + Return. Saves a fraction of a second if you're in the middle of a line. Very similarly, Ctrl + Return pushes down the text on the current line .</li>
<li><strong>Search for resources and types</strong>.  Ctrl + Shift + R. You can definitely do fine without removing lines quickly, but searching for resources (or restricted to type -- Ctrl + Shift + T), you can't.</li>
<li><strong>Copy lines</strong>. Ctrl + Alt + Down/Up. Both this one, and move line below, is hugely convenient during refactoring.</li>
<li><strong>Move lines</strong>. Alt + Down/Up.</li>
<li><strong>Move to next compilation error or warning</strong>. Ctrl + . (dot). Not as important, but helpful. When you're editing a file that is larger than it probably should be.</li>
<li><strong>Run test</strong>. While in test window,  Shift + Alt + X (release keys) + T. Probably the  most complicated, and one that is rarely used in my experience. Still helpful. Pressing J instead of T runs the file as a Java Application.</li>
<li><strong>Refactor</strong>. Shift + Alt + R. Can be used on filenames, classnames and all members, and saves a lot of name refactoring grief.</li>
<li><strong>Correct indentation</strong>. Ctrl + I. Corrects the indentation on selected lines.</li>
<li><strong>See where method is called</strong>. Ctrl + Alt + H. Very good to have around when getting to know someone else's code (or maybe your own if it was some time ago).</li>
<li><strong>See declaration of type or member</strong>.  F3. Basically jumps to the top of chosen type or class member. Extremely helpful.</li>
<li><strong>Type hierarchy</strong>. F4.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can bind short-cuts to everything you can imagine, just check out <em>Windows > Preferences > General > Keys</em>.</p>
