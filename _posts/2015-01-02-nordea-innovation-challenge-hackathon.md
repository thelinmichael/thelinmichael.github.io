IBM and Swedish bank Nordea arranged a hackathon called [Nordea Innovation Challenge]("http://nordeainnovationchallenge.com/") in downtown Stockholm in late November. The theme: "Banking of the Future."

I attended together with four colleagues from Spotify, and at the end of the hack we were super proud to claim the 20'000 SEK first prize with our [Spending Visualizer]("http://nerdea.mybluemix.net/"), heavily inspired by FourSquare's [Time Machine]("https://foursquare.com/timemachine").

My key learnings to win a hackathon is that you should focus on the prototype's front-end, presentation, idea, front-end again. Let what the jury is looking for, e.g. the hackathon theme or utilised tools inspire the idea. A good hackathon jury has listed how the prioritise the different aspects of every hack. Unless the hackathon has a clear relation to a specific backend, I'd recommend spending as little time on the backend as possible. (This hackathon was strongly linked to [IBM's Bluemix platform]("http://www-01.ibm.com/software/bluemix/"), which all contributions was building upon. Part of the jury's valuation was creative ways to utilise Bluemix.)
