I've attended two diversity events in the last couple of weeks. One was held internally at Spotify, and one was a meetup hosted by [Silicon Vikings](http://siliconvikings.com/) at the Spotify office with speakers from among others the Stockholm startup [TrueCaller](https://www.truecaller.com).

I'm missing a meetup that focuses on a different angle than gender. No doubt important, but while both of the events were about diversity, they were focused on gender diversity but only had a minor mention of other poorly represented groups. It would be refreshing if a considerable part of an event would be dedicated to diversity in age, ethnicity, or socioeconomic background. (For some reason, [higher participation of lower-economic backgrounds were seen in Computer Science majors in the U.K. through 2004-2010 compared to other STEM subjects](http://sciencecampaign.org.uk/documents/2012/CaSESTEMSESBriefing.pdf).)
