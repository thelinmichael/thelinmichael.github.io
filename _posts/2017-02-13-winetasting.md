Another non-technical post - Oh dear.

If you've landed on this page, you may be someone who is looking for a simple way to create a wine tasting experience, described in as much detail so that you could easily copy the steps. That was at least what I was looking for. Since my Google Foo wasn't strong enough to find that, I was left to my own devices. I've shared the steps here. 

Some personal background: I don't know a lot about wine. At all. I usually just pick up _Something from Rioja_. Or _That wine with a twig wrapped around the Bottle._ I've attended a wine tasting _once_. But I figured that it couldn't be _that_ difficult to do it decently. And if not decently, then at least a bit of fun. 

#### The Theme
As with everything you want to try out, you want to find a single variable that you can vary that may or may not affect the end result. Everything else should stay the same. So for this tasting, I chose to go with **black grape** as the variable that'd vary. 

Other variables that I wanted to have static

- **Country**: The wines should be from the same country.

- **Year**: The wines should be of the same age.

- **Price**: The wines should be in the same price range.

I went with wines from **France** made around **2013**, costing close to **100 SEK** (about $11) per bottle.

Further restrictions on the range of possible wines to choose from: 
- Since I live in Sweden, the only place to buy wine at is Systembolaget - the **state monopoly for strong alcoholic beverages**. The
- And since we were only two people doing the tasting, with *no* intention of spitting anything out, the bottles had to be available in the **smaller 375 ml bottle format**. This constraint _really_ restricted the number of wines to choose from. So doing this with at least four to six people would open up a lot more options.

#### The Wines
From what was available off the shelf at Systembolaget, the wines I chose were

* 2015 Bourgogne Rouge from Burgundy, a **Pinot noir** grape wine (60 SEK / $6.73) ([Systembolaget](https://www.systembolaget.se/dryck/roda-viner/bourgogne-rouge-547502))

* 2012 Château Boutisse from Bordeaux, a mostly **Merlot** grape wine (99 SEK / $11.10) ([Systembolaget](https://www.systembolaget.se/dryck/roda-viner/chateau-boutisse-681302))

* 2013 Domaine du Vieux Lazaret from Rhône, a **Syrah/Shiraz** grape wine (110 SEK / $12.33) ([Systembolaget](https://www.systembolaget.se/dryck/roda-viner/domaine-du-vieux-lazaret-221102))

* 2013 Château Plantier Rose Cru Bourgeois from Bordeaux, a mostly **Cabernet Sauvignon** grape wine. (130 SEK / $14.57) ([Systembolaget](https://www.systembolaget.se/dryck/roda-viner/chateau-plantier-rose-362602))

Total cost: 399 SEK ($44.73)

Due to a lack of options, I had to be a bit flexible on the year and the purity of the grapes in the wines. The wines containing Merlot and the Cabernet Sauvignon grapes are blends. (Château Boutisse contains both Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon grapes. Château Plantier Rose Cru Bourgeois contains 62% Cabernet Sauvignon, 30% Merlot, and 8% Petit Verdot.)

#### The Tasting and the Challenge

The common way to do a wine tasting is to tell people what they're drinking, but without saying too much about what they should taste like to not anchor their personal interpretation.

I wanted this tasting to have a bit of a challenge to it. (A presentation about the wines, wineyards, regions, and so on would've required way more authenticity as a wine expert than I could possibly acquire.)

By pouring the wines into glasses without disclosing which one contained which, but giving clues about what the different wines _should_ look like, smell like, and taste like, I asked my date to identify the wines and place them next to the correct bottle. 

![Wine challenge]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/vin.jpg "Wine challenge set up")

Below is a brief and simplified cheat sheet that works for the wines listed above. Not necessarily what's typical about each grape variety.

| Grape | Look | Aroma & Flavour | Body  
| -------- | ---- | ---- | ------------
| Pinot Noir | Pale in colour, almost translucent. Mostly red, with some blue. | Aroma of berries with notes of forest raspberry, blueberries, cinnamon and herbs. | Light
    | Merlot | Slightly lighter in color than Cabernet Sauvignon. Dark, blue-red colour in the center. Slightly orange tones on the rim. | Scent of oak, hints of plums, currants, coffee, dark chocolate and tobacco. | Medium/Full
| Syrah/Shiraz | Opaque purple-black. | Spicy, nuanced scent with hints of barrel, raspberries, strawberries, bay leaf, pepper and meat. | Full 
| Cabernet Sauvignon | Near opaque, but less than Syrah. Dark ruby colour.| Subtle, fruity aroma with clear  oak character, hints of black currants, coconut, plum, cedar, coffee and mint. | Full

To assist her in identifying the correct smells, I had bought one **Reference Ingredient** for each wine.

| Wine | Grape | Reference Ingredient 
| -------- | ---- | ---- 
| Bourgogne Rouge | Pinot Noir | Cinnamon sticks
| Château Boutisse | Merlot | Currants
| Domaine du Vieux Lazaret | Syrah/Shiraz | Bay leaves
| Château Plantier Rose Cru Bourgeois | Cabernet Sauvignon | Mint leaves

After _a lot_ of smelling and even more tasting, she managed to pair the anonymous glasses to the correct bottles. In total, it took about 45 minutes. 

The Pinot Noir grape was easiest one to identify by its looks, and the Cabernet Sauvignon grape easiest to identify by its very distinct smell and taste. The reference ingredients turned out to not be that much of a help, but it was a fun addition and I'd use them again. (It's very possible that I simply chose reference ingredients that weren't that distinguished in the smell and/or taste.)

#### Things to do differently next time

* **Different reference integredients.** Not sure which ingredient was the most useful to be honest - they were all really strong compared to the aroma coming from the wine and there was no immediate hit. The Cabernet Sauvignon was easily identifiable by just sharing that it's supposed to smell like oak. 

* **Avoiding blends**. I think you can have a lot of fun doing this with your date. However, having 3-4 people join the tasting opens up to a lot more wines to chose from. (It'd enable you to buy 750 ml bottles, of which there are a _lot more of_. Or just drink a lot more per person!) This way it'd be easier to stear clear of wines made out of multiple grapes.

I can really recommend the [Wine Basics](http://winefolly.com/wine-basics-beginners-guide/) at Winefolly for other beginners. I'm a sucker for good infographics, and they've got a lot of them.
