excerpt: Merging five images to achieve a broader depth of field
---
Since I bought a macro lens last week I've been trying to recreate some of the amazing images of insects and flowers I've seen around the interwebs. I immediately ran into the issue of not being able to get a wide enough depth of field, causing my object to be mostly out of focus.

Shooting this from the Minimum Focus Distance to achieve 1:1 [magnification](https://www.dpreview.com/articles/6519974919/macro-photography-understanding-magnification) causes a shallower depth of field. Using a tripod enables you to close the aparture down to f/16 or even lower to increase the depth of field, but it's still too shallow to have the entire object in focus.

Enter focus stacking. In principle, it's a simple procedure.

Take several images, each image focusing on a different part of the object, and merge to a single image using only the parts that are in focus. 

#### Take the images

I'm using Lightroom and Adobe Photoshop for this, but there are probably a lot of different software available.

#### Export as JPG
