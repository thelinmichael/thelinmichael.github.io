I ended last week's company hackweek with attending [Hack The Globe](http://www.hacktheglobe.org/ "http://www.hacktheglobe.org/") in Stockholm to help competitors with Spotify's APIs.

It's so obvious that attending hackathons as an opportunity to sit down with developers, helping them and bouncing ideas, is one of the best ways to retrieve feedback on what's good, bad, and what's really needed from our APIs.
