excerpt: As an amateur runner it's a bit silly to push yourself towards beating a certain time treshold. As if enjoying nature, the company of a running mate, the endorphine rush, or being healthy just isn't enough. It's fun and it's motivating, and I suppose it gives you the feeling of making progress. But it doesn't _really_ matter.

Non-technical for a 'blog' that's up on Github, but whatever. 

As an amateur runner it's a bit silly to push yourself towards beating a certain time treshold. As if enjoying nature, the company of a running mate, the endorphine rush, or being healthy just isn't enough. It's fun and it's motivating, and I suppose it gives you the feeling of making progress. But it doesn't _really_ matter.

##### Best times in 2016:

| Distance      	| Time    	| Pace | Name of Race            	| Date |
|---------------	|---------	|-------| ------------------	|----------	 |
| 5K            	| [20:22](https://www.strava.com/activities/737989478/overview)   	| 4:04 min/km | Mental Health Run       	| Oct |  	  
| 10K           	| [42:52](https://www.strava.com/activities/766274369/overview)   	| 4:17 min/km | Vintermilen             	| Nov |	 
| Half Marathon 	| [1:42:34](https://www.strava.com/activities/568187103/overview) 	| 4:51 min/km | Stockholm Half Marathon 	| May |    	

Between January and June I did about 20 km per week, coming to a complete stop in the first week of June. Running became impossible due to sharp pain in both of my heels, caused by what I believe was playing football in newly bought indoors football shoes on artificial grass turf. After three months of almost no exercise, I've been slowly increasing the weekly distance to 25-45 kilometers. 

[Google set OKRs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJB83EZtAjc) that are **stretch goals** to force their employees to **explore new and potentially unknown ways to reach them**. And since they're stretch goals, they're not expected to be achieved. _“Shoot for the moon. Even if you miss, you'll land among the stars”_, sort of. 

##### Stretch goals for 2017:

| Distance      	| Goal time    	| Goal Pace | Pace diff. from 2016 result |
|---------------	| ---------	| ------ | ------------------ |
| 5K            	| 19:00 | 3:48 min/km | -0:16 min/km |
| 10K           	| 40:00 | 4:00 min/km | -0:17 min/km |
| Half Marathon 	| 1:30:00 | 4:16 min/km | -0:36 min/km |

Silly as it is, I know that I'll be screaming in joy if I ever beat one of these times. But at the end of the day, exercising shouldn't add further stress and feel fullfilling, and something tells me that the goals set out above won't be reached in years, if ever. And that's totally fine. So establish your stretch goals - worst case is that you're _just healthy_.
