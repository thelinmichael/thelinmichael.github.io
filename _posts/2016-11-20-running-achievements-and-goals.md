excerpt: As an amateur runner it's a bit silly to push yourself towards beating a certain time treshold. As if enjoying nature, the company of a running mate, the endorphine rush, or being healthy just isn't enough. It's fun and it's motivating, and I suppose it gives you the feeling of making progress. But it doesn't really matter.

Non-technical post for a 'blog' that's up on Github, but whatever. 

As an amateur runner it's a bit silly to push yourself towards beating a certain time treshold. As if enjoying nature, the company of a running mate, the endorphine rush, or being healthy just isn't enough. But it's fun and it's motivating, and I suppose it gives you the feeling of making progress. 

[Google set OKRs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJB83EZtAjc) that are **stretch goals** to force their employees to **explore new and potentially unknown ways to reach them**. And since they're stretch goals, they're not expected to be achieved. _“Shoot for the moon. Even if you miss, you'll land among the stars”_, sort of. 

I figured I'd put my own running stretch goals up, as a reminder to myself when it's freezing outside.

Using the best finishing times from 2016 as input:

| Distance | Time | Pace | Name of Race | Date 
| -------- | ---- | ---- | ------------ | ----
| 5K | [20:22](https://www.strava.com/activities/737989478/overview) | 4:04 min/km | Mental Health Run | Oct  	  
| 10K | [42:52](https://www.strava.com/activities/766274369/overview) | 4:17 min/km | Vintermilen | Nov 
| Half Marathon | [1:42:34](https://www.strava.com/activities/568187103/overview) | 4:51 min/km | Stockholm Half Marathon | May       

Into establishing stretch goal for 2017:

| Distance | Goal time | Goal Pace | Pace diff. from 2016 result 
| -------- | --------- | --------- | ---------------------------
| 5K | 19:00 | 3:48 min/km | -0:16 min/km 
| 10K | 40:00 | 4:00 min/km | -0:17 min/km 
| Half Marathon | 1:30:00 | 4:16 min/km | -0:36 min/km  
 
If you believe that there's a considerable amount of dark magic required to reach a goal, you're doing it right. I'll be rummaging around the Internet looking for a sorcerer.
