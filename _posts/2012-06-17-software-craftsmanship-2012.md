Took the train up to Bletchley to attend [Software Craftsmanship 2012](http://www.codemanship.co.uk/softwarecraftsmanship/ "Software Craftsmanship 2012") earlier this week.  The conference, or rather the workshop, spanned over a full day on things related to pair programming, continuous integration, and test driven development, and also included a tour of the [National Museum of Computing](http://www.tnmoc.org/ "National Museum of Computing"). Both event and museum are located at Bletchley Park, a bit more than an hour north of London. During the Second World War, Bletchley Park was the home of several thousand employees working on the decryption of messages captured by the German military. The most famous among the people who worked at Bletchley  was probably mathematician and computer science father [Alan Turing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing "Alan Turing").

Very much recommend Software Craftsmanship, and as far as I know they'll be hosting another one next year. It was a great opportunity to experience some history, to learn about new topics, and to collaborate with others.
